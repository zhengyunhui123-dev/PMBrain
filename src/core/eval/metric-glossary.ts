/**
 * v0.32.3 — Single source of truth for evaluation-metric plain-English
 * glosses. Drives `pmbrain search stats` JSON output (`_meta.metric_glossary`
 * block), `pmbrain eval compare` reports, and the auto-generated
 * `docs/eval/METRIC_GLOSSARY.md` file.
 *
 * Per [CDX-25]: glosses live in one `_meta.metric_glossary` block per
 * response, NOT as sibling `_gloss` fields on every metric. Less invasive
 * to machine-readable consumers (gbrain-evals repo, CI gates).
 *
 * Every entry has THREE fields:
 *   - industry_term: the canonical name used in IR / NLP literature
 *     (preserved verbatim so users searching the literature find what we
 *     report)
 *   - eli10: plain-English explanation a 16-year-old could follow
 *   - range: explicit numeric range + interpretation ("higher is better",
 *     "0..1 where 1 = perfect")
 *
 * The doc generator at `scripts/generate-metric-glossary.ts` consumes this
 * module and writes `docs/eval/METRIC_GLOSSARY.md`. A CI guard
 * (`scripts/check-eval-glossary-fresh.sh`) regenerates the doc and diffs
 * against the committed version — out-of-date docs fail the build.
