/**
 * Provider capability detection for the gateway-native subagent tool loop.
 *
 * Pre-v0.38 the subagent loop was Anthropic-direct (`new Anthropic()` instantiated
 * in `src/core/minions/handlers/subagent.ts`). The three-layer pin
 * (`queue.ts:87-106` + `subagent.ts:149-167` + `doctor.ts:1190-1225` enforced
 * Anthropic-only because crash-replay relied on Anthropic's stable `tool_use_id`s
 * for reconciliation. v0.38 (D11) moves the stable-ID generation gbrain-side
 * (ordinal + uuid v7 persisted in `subagent_tool_executions` at first observation),
 * which decouples the loop from any specific provider's response format.
 *
 * This module reads capabilities from the recipe (`src/core/ai/recipes/*.ts`)
 * and surfaces them via a normalized `ProviderCapabilities` shape that the
 * gateway's `toolLoop()` consumes to decide:
 *   - REFUSE at submit when tool-calling is unsupported (D6 — useless loop)
 *   - WARN at submit when prompt caching is unavailable (D6 — cost regression)
 *   - INFO at submit when parallel tools unsupported (D6 — just slower)
 *
 * The capability shape is intentionally narrow. Per-call cost is already in
 * `ChatTouchpoint.cost_per_1m_*`; we don't re-export it here because routing
 * decisions don't depend on it.
