/**
 * src/core/source-id.ts — single canonical source_id validation.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design (no imports beyond TS stdlib). Imported by both
 * engines, cycle, source-resolver, sources-ops, and any future site that
 * needs to validate a source_id. Pre-v0.38 the regex was duplicated across
 * three files (`utils.ts` had a permissive variant; `sources-ops.ts` and
 * `source-resolver.ts` had the strict variant). Codex outside-voice flagged
 * the drift; this module is the consolidation.
 *
 * **Canonical regex (strict):** `^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]{0,30}[a-z0-9])?$`
 *
 * Rules enforced:
 *   - 1-32 characters
 *   - lowercase alphanumeric only (no underscores, no dots, no slashes)
 *   - interior hyphens allowed
 *   - first and last character must be alphanumeric (no edge hyphens)
 *
 * Single-character source IDs like `a` or `1` are valid. Underscored ids
 * like `my_source` are rejected even though they passed the legacy
 * permissive regex — `sources-ops` always rejected them at creation time,
 * so no existing source IDs break.
 *
 * **Exports two validators:**
 *   - `isValidSourceId(s)`: boolean — for tiers that silently fall back
 *     to the next resolution step on invalid input (dotfile, brain_default).
 *   - `assertValidSourceId(s)`: void, throws — for tiers that must reject
 *     invalid input loudly (explicit `--source` flag, `GBRAIN_SOURCE` env,
 *     `cycleLockIdFor` primitive defense-in-depth).
 *
 * Codex P1-F flagged the need for both shapes.
