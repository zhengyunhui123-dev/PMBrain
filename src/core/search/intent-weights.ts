/**
 * Zero-LLM Intent → Weight Adjustment (v0.32.x — search-lite)
 *
 * Sits on top of the existing query-intent classifier. The classifier
 * (src/core/search/query-intent.ts) already produces an `intent` field
 * with 4 values: entity / temporal / event / general. This module maps
 * that intent onto concrete weight adjustments applied during the hybrid
 * search pipeline:
 *
 *   - entity   → boost exact slug/title matches (keyword pre-filter favored)
 *   - temporal → increase recency scoring weight (recency = 'on' when caller
 *                left it undefined)
 *   - event    → increase keyword weight in hybrid fusion (event queries
 *                tend to have rare named entities that keyword search nails
 *                while vector search smears across paraphrases)
 *   - general  → default semantic (no adjustment)
 *
 * All adjustments are SUBTLE — they nudge weights, they don't override
 * caller-explicit options. If the caller passed `recency: 'off'`, intent
 * weighting will NOT silently re-enable it. The classifier is a default,
 * not a mandate.
 *
 * The original v0.20.0 LLM query expansion path (expandQuery in
 * expansion.ts) still exists and is opt-in via `opts.expansion = true`.
 * Intent weighting is the new DEFAULT, and replaces the expansion call
 * for the common case (simple queries, no API key, fast loop).
 *
 * Pure module. No DB, no LLM, no async. Tested in
 * test/intent-weights.test.ts.

/**
 * Weight adjustments to apply for a classified intent. All factors are
 * multiplicative on the existing pipeline weights; the defaults map to
 * 1.0 (no-op) for the `general` intent. A factor > 1.0 increases the
 * weight of that signal; < 1.0 decreases it.
 *
 * Magnitudes were tuned conservatively (max 1.25x boost) so the existing
 * search behavior on ambiguous queries stays close to v0.31.x. The point
 * of the classifier isn't to flip rankings — it's to break ties in
 * favor of the user's plausible intent.
