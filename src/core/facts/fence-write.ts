/**
 * v0.32.2 — markdown-first fact write path.
 *
 * The "system of record" invariant means new facts land in the entity
 * page's `## Facts` fence FIRST, then the DB index gets stamped via
 * engine.insertFacts. After this commit, every write path that wants
 * persistent fact storage routes through `writeFactsToFence`. The DB
 * single-row `engine.insertFact` stays in the surface for the
 * legacy / thin-client fallback only (when the brain has no
 * sources.local_path configured).
 *
 * Concurrency: reuses the v0.28 page-lock primitive
 * (`src/core/page-lock.ts`), an FS-level lockfile under
 * `~/.gbrain/page-locks/<sha256-of-slug>.lock` with PID-liveness +
 * 5-minute TTL. Multi-process safe — two `gbrain` invocations writing
 * to the same entity page serialize through the same kernel-visible
 * lockfile. 5-second timeout per the plan's "5s retry" failure mode.
 *
 * Atomicity: write the fence to `<file>.tmp`, re-parse the .tmp body,
 * THEN `renameSync` to the canonical file. If parse fails the .tmp
 * stays in place as quarantine evidence and the JSONL surface
 * (`facts.write_failures.jsonl`) records the failure for `gbrain
 * doctor` to surface. The on-disk markdown file is never corrupted
 * mid-write (renameSync is atomic on POSIX) and the DB is never
 * inserted when the fence isn't valid (Codex Q7 atomic-write
 * recovery).
 *
 * No re-entrancy needed: writeFactsToFence uses fs.writeFileSync +
 * renameSync directly — NOT engine.putPage — so no code path can
 * re-trigger runFactsBackstop on the markdown write. The architecture
 * self-prevents the recursion concern Codex Q7 raised; documenting
 * here so a future refactor that swaps writeFileSync for putPage
 * sees the constraint.
