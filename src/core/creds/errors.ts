/**
 * creds/errors — the typed credential error catalog.
 *
 * Every failure a user can hit while connecting or refreshing a credential
 * maps to one CredentialError with four user-facing fields: what happened
 * (problem), why (cause), the exact fix, and a doc link. Two renderings:
 *  - conversational one-liner, fix first (stderr / [SHOW USER] blocks)
 *  - structured JSON (`--json` envelopes: { code, problem, cause, fix, doc_url })
 *
 * The catalog is the single source of truth for
 * docs/guides/google-connect.md's troubleshooting table — update both
 * together. No CLI imports here: the hosted product reuses this module.
