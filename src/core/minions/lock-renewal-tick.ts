/**
 * Pure lock-renewal tick (v0.41.22.2).
 *
 * Extracted from `MinionWorker.launchJob`'s setInterval body so the
 * lock-renewal state machine is testable without timer / process
 * surface. The worker reduces to a thin sync wrapper that calls
 * `runLockRenewalTick` from inside `setInterval(() => {...})`; all
 * decision logic, error-handling, and audit hooks live here as a pure
 * function over injected dependencies.
 *
 * Closes the v0.41.22.1 production crash class
 * (`unhandledRejection at renewLock`) AND four additional gaps the
 * outside-voice (codex) review surfaced:
 *
 *   - **Hung renewLock**: the original PR's re-entrancy guard skipped
 *     overlapping ticks but a permanently-pending await would wedge the
 *     guard forever. `runLockRenewalTick` wraps each renewLock in
 *     `Promise.race(call, timeoutPromise)` with `callTimeoutMs` so the
 *     call cannot pend longer than the configured budget.
 *
 *   - **Threshold math**: with `lockDuration=30s` and `interval=15s`,
 *     a 3-strike count-based abort fires at t=45s but the lock has
 *     been reclaimable since t=30s — a 15s window where another
 *     worker can claim the same job. `runLockRenewalTick` aborts based
 *     on `Date.now() - lastSuccessfulRenewalAt >= lockDuration -
 *     safetyMargin` (time-based), so the worker voluntarily releases
 *     BEFORE the stall detector can reclaim. The failure counter is
 *     kept for audit-event labeling only.
 *
 *   - **Cancelled-tick race**: if the job ends while a renewLock call
 *     is mid-flight, the IIFE in worker.ts must bail without writing
 *     a misleading audit event. State carries a `cancelled` thunk
 *     that the tick checks at three points (entry, after the await
 *     resolves, after the await throws).
 *
 *   - **Audit defense-in-depth**: each call into the audit sink is
 *     wrapped in its own inner try/catch. The audit-writer primitive
 *     already promises "best-effort, never throws," but a defense
 *     layer here keeps a misbehaving audit from re-introducing the
 *     unhandledRejection bug class through a new surface.
 *
 * Pure function — no I/O, no module-level state, no closure-over-class
 * fields. All effects route through injected `deps` so tests are
 * trivially hermetic.
 *
 * Knob resolution lives in `resolveLockRenewalKnobs(env, lockDuration)`
 * below; tests + workers both consume it.
