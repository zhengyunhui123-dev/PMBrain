/**
 * v0.38 PHASE_SCOPE coverage regression.
 *
 * The phase-scope taxonomy in `src/core/cycle.ts` is documentation, not
 * runtime enforcement (deferred TODO per plan). This test guards the
 * static contract:
 *
 *   1. Every `ALL_PHASES` entry has a `PHASE_SCOPE` entry. New phases
 *      added without taxonomy declaration fail this test.
 *   2. No extra `PHASE_SCOPE` entries beyond `ALL_PHASES`. Stale entries
 *      from removed phases fail this test.
 *   3. Every value is one of 'source' | 'global' | 'mixed' (type check).
 *
 * Future fan-out wave consumes PHASE_SCOPE directly; this test makes
 * the contract enforceable at the unit-test layer.
