/**
 * E2E test pinning the PostgresEngine.disconnect() idempotency invariant.
 *
 * Background: when commit 671ef099 added engine.disconnect() to
 * MinionWorker.start()'s finally block, every test that calls worker.start()
 * AND then engine.disconnect() in its own finally was double-disconnecting
 * the same engine instance. Pre-fix, the second disconnect found _sql=null
 * and fell through to the `else` branch which calls db.disconnect() — but
 * db.disconnect() clears the GLOBAL module-level connection, breaking
 * unrelated downstream tests (their getConn() throws "no database
 * connection" on the next beforeEach).
 *
 * The fix: PostgresEngine tracks `_connectionStyle` ('instance' | 'module')
 * and only calls db.disconnect() when it actually owns the module-level
 * connection. Second disconnect on an instance-pool engine is a no-op.
 *
 * This test pins the contract so future refactors of disconnect() can't
 * silently regress (it's exactly the bug class that took an hour of E2E
 * debugging to find). Two cases:
 *   1. instance-pool engine: connect → disconnect → disconnect must NOT
 *      affect the module-level connection.
 *   2. module-singleton engine: connect → disconnect → disconnect is safe
 *      (second call no-ops).
