/**
 * v0.41.8.0 — PGLiteEngine.disconnect() lifecycle regression tests.
 *
 * Pins the invariants the v0.41.8.0 hang fix wave depends on:
 *
 *   1. ORDERING: `db.close()` is called BEFORE the file lock is
 *      released. A sibling process must not be able to acquire the
 *      lock and try to connect to a still-closing brain. PR #1337's
 *      original diff swapped this to release-then-close — we
 *      explicitly REJECTED that ordering. This test fails if a
 *      future maintainer reads the PR and applies the swap.
 *
 *   2. SNAPSHOT + EARLY-NULL: `this._db` is nulled BEFORE awaiting
 *      `close()`, so a concurrent `connect()` cannot observe a
 *      partial mid-close state. PR #1337's load-bearing contribution
 *      that we DID take.
 *
 *   3. LOCK LEAK GUARD: if `db.close()` throws, the file lock STILL
 *      releases. Codex outside-voice finding #7 in the eng review:
 *      without try/finally, a close-throw would wedge every next
 *      gbrain invocation on the stale lock.
 *
 *   4. IDEMPOTENCY: calling disconnect() twice is a clean no-op on
 *      the second call (no throw, no double-close attempt).
 *
 *   5. DOUBLE-DISCONNECT THEN CONNECT: after disconnect, a fresh
 *      connect() sees clean state and succeeds.
 *
 * Marked .serial because PGLite WASM cold-start dominates wallclock
 * for fresh-engine-per-test cases — running these in the parallel
 * shard pool would starve other PGLite tests of cold-start time.
