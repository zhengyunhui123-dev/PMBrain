# Partition unit test files into N shards and run one shard.
#
# Usage: scripts/test-shard.sh <shard-index> <total-shards>
#   shard-index: 1-based (1..N)
#   total-shards: positive integer
#
# Excluded from sharding:
#   - test/e2e/*           — need DATABASE_URL; run via bun run test:e2e
#   - *.serial.test.ts     — concurrency-unsafe (file-wide mock.module / env
#                            leaks); run via bun run test:serial on its
#                            own runner in CI. Including these here lets
#                            their mock.module() calls leak into the rest
#                            of the shard's bun process and silently break
#                            unrelated tests.
#
# *.slow.test.ts is deliberately INCLUDED here. CI's matrix is the only
# default place these run; the local fast loop (run-unit-shard.sh)
# excludes them. See CLAUDE.md "CI vs local: intentionally divergent file
# sets" for the rationale.
#
# Partition: weight-aware LPT bin-packing via scripts/sharding.ts. Reads
# per-file runtime weights from scripts/test-weights.json (mined from real
# CI logs by scripts/mine-shard-weights.ts). Files absent from the map
# fall back to the corpus median, so adding a new test file works
# immediately without regenerating weights — worst case it lands in the
# wrong shard until next regen, never silently dropped.
#
# Stable partitioning: same `(files, weights, N)` always produces the
# same assignment, so retries are reproducible.
