# v0.39 — CI guard against bypassing the localOnly filter on the HTTP MCP
# surface. Lives alongside check-jsonb-pattern.sh / check-progress-to-stdout.sh
# in the bun run verify chain.
#
# Background: serve-http.ts builds the HTTP MCP tools/list response from
# `operations.filter(op => !op.localOnly)`. That filter is the only thing
# keeping localOnly ops (sync_brain, file_upload, file_list, file_url —
# any admin op the user EXPLICITLY marked as CLI-only) off the wire.
#
# If a future HTTP-exposing module imports `operations` from
# core/operations.ts WITHOUT applying the filter, the localOnly contract
# silently breaks: a write-scoped OAuth client could submit `sync_brain`
# or `file_upload` over HTTP. Codex outside-voice review of the e2e-test-
# wave (CMT-3) flagged this exact bypass class.
#
# The guard works by:
#   1. Listing every file that imports `operations` from core/operations.ts.
#   2. Comparing against an explicit ALLOWLIST of known-safe importers
#      (each with a rationale below).
#   3. Failing if a new file is missing from the allowlist — forces the
#      author to either (a) join the allowlist with an explicit rationale,
#      or (b) apply the canonical filter at import.
#
# This is a structural defense. The runtime defense lives in
# test/operations-trust-boundary.test.ts (the canonical filter contract +
# handler-invocation cases for the historically-broken classes).
#
# To allow a new importer: add the relative path to ALLOWED below with a
# one-line comment explaining why localOnly isn't a concern there.
#
# Exit: 0 when no unknown importers, 1 when at least one is missing from
# the allowlist.

# Pattern: any import that brings the `operations` VALUE in from core/operations.ts.
# Three shapes the value can enter through; each must be caught:
#   - destructured:    import { operations } from '...core/operations.ts'
#   - aliased:         import { operations as ops } from '...core/operations.ts'
#   - namespace:       import * as opsModule from '...core/operations.ts'
# The original narrow regex only matched the destructured form — codex caught
# the bypass class during /ship adversarial review (aliased + namespace forms
# slipped through). The broadened regex below specifically requires `operations`
# inside the destructured clause OR a namespace import (`* as X`); type-only
# imports of sibling exports like `sourceScopeOpts` / `OperationContext` are
# left alone (those don't expose the op list to a transport surface).
