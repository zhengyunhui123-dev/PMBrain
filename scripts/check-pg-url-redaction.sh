# a postgresql:// URL with userinfo to a logging surface.
#
# Specifically we forbid string literals or template substitutions that
# look like `postgresql://user:pass@host` being passed to:
#   - console.log / .warn / .error
#   - process.stderr.write / process.stdout.write
#   - appendFileSync / writeFileSync (audit JSONL writes)
#   - new logging APIs that may show up later (the regex matches the URL,
#     not the consumer; any leak will trip)
#
# Wired into bun run check:all and bun run verify.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = found at least one suspect line.
