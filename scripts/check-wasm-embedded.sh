# CI guard: verify that bun --compile binaries ship with embedded tree-sitter
# WASMs and produce real semantic chunks (not recursive-fallback chunks).
#
# This is the #1 silent-failure mode for v0.19.0 code indexing. If the WASM
# import attributes regress or the asset path drifts, the compiled binary
# silently falls through to the recursive text chunker. Users see no error,
# just degraded chunking quality. This script catches that regression.
#
# Fails the build when:
#   - bun build --compile fails
#   - The resulting binary can't parse TypeScript
#   - Chunks come back without real symbol names (fallback signature)
#
# Runs as part of `bun test` via the package.json pre-test pipeline.
