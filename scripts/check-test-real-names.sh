# CI guard: fail if any test fixture references a real person's name.
#
# CLAUDE.md's "Privacy rule" section is unambiguous: never reference real
# people, companies, funds, or private agent names in any public-facing
# artifact. Tests are checked-in code distributed with every release and
# indexed by GitHub search. This guard catches the patterns the rule names.
#
# Design (post-Codex F4 review):
#   - Banned names: exact-string allowlist of known real identifiers. Adding
#     a name when CLAUDE.md flags one is a one-line edit.
#   - Banned emails: specific addresses that identify real contacts. NOT a
#     broad corporate-email regex — those would catch legitimate fixture
#     domains in billing/auth tests (`customer@stripe.com` etc.).
#   - Allowlist: exact "file:offending-string" pairs that are intentional
#     and pre-existing (e.g., the user's own email is not a "contact").
#
# Scope: test/**/*.test.ts only. Historical CHANGELOG entries, doc examples,
# and skill READMEs each have their own scrub status and are out of scope
# for this guard.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-test-real-names.sh
# Exit:  0 clean, 1 banned reference found, 2 setup error (rg + grep missing).
