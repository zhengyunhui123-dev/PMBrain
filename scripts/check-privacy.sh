# check-privacy.sh — CLAUDE.md:550 enforcement.
#
# CLAUDE.md forbids the private OpenClaw fork name in public artifacts:
# CHANGELOG.md, README.md, docs/, skills/, PR titles + bodies, commit
# messages, and comments in checked-in code. This script greps for the
# banned name in either the staged index (for pre-commit hooks) or the
# working tree (for CI) and fails loudly if found.
#
# The allow-list below whitelists files where the name is legitimate
# — specifically, files that must name the pattern in order to enforce it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-privacy.sh          # scan working tree
#   scripts/check-privacy.sh --staged # scan git staged index
#   scripts/check-privacy.sh --help
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  clean
#   1  banned name found (or --help printed)
#   2  git / grep not available

scripts/check-privacy.sh — scan for the banned OpenClaw fork name.

USAGE:
  scripts/check-privacy.sh           Scan all tracked files in the working tree.
  scripts/check-privacy.sh --staged  Scan only files staged for commit.
  scripts/check-privacy.sh --help    Show this message.

The script greps for '${BANNED_NAME}' (case-insensitive) in:
  - CHANGELOG.md, README.md
  - docs/**
  - skills/**
  - src/**
  - test/**
  - scripts/**

Allow-list (references to the name are permitted):
  - scripts/check-privacy.sh itself
  - .git/** (branch names, commit history — not checked in artifacts)

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 banned name found, 2 setup error.
