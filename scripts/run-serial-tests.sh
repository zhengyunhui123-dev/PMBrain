# Serial files are tests that share file-wide state (top-level mock.module,
# module-level singletons that intentionally cross test cases) and would race
# under intra-file concurrency. Discovered via filename suffix; no annotation
# inside the file is needed.
#
# Excluded by run-unit-shard.sh and run-unit-parallel.sh's parallel pass.
# Invoked separately by run-unit-parallel.sh after the parallel pass succeeds.
