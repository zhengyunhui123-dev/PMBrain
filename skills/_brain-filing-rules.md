# Brain Filing Rules -- MANDATORY for all skills that write to the brain

## The Rule

The PRIMARY SUBJECT of the content determines where it goes. Not the format,
not the source, not the skill that's running.

## Decision Protocol

1. Identify the primary subject (a person? company? concept? policy issue?)
2. File in the directory that matches the subject
3. Cross-link from related directories
4. When in doubt: what would you search for to find this page again?

## Common Misfiling Patterns -- DO NOT DO THESE

| Wrong | Right | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Analysis of a topic -> `sources/` | -> appropriate subject directory | sources/ is for raw data only |
| Article about a person -> `sources/` | -> `people/` | Primary subject is a person |
| Meeting-derived company info -> `meetings/` only | -> ALSO update `companies/` | Entity propagation is mandatory |
| Research about a company -> `sources/` | -> `companies/` | Primary subject is a company |
| Reusable framework/thesis -> `sources/` | -> `concepts/` | It's a mental model |
| Tweet thread about policy -> `media/` | -> `civic/` or `concepts/` | media/ is for content ops |

## Sanctioned exception: synthesis output is sui generis

The "file by primary subject" rule is for raw ingest. Synthesized output that
is one-of-one to a single source AND a specific reader (a personalized book
mirror, a strategic-reading playbook tied to one problem) does not fit any
subject directory cleanly: filing by topic loses the "this is the book"
dimension; filing by author muddles authorship pages with synthesis pages.

Format-prefixed paths under `media/<format>/<slug>` are the sanctioned
exception:

- `media/books/<slug>-personalized.md` (book-mirror output)
- `media/articles/<slug>-personalized.md` (long-form article personalization)

If you find yourself wanting `media/<format>/` for raw ingest, that is still
the anti-pattern in the table above. The exception is narrow: synthesized,
one-of-one, sui generis to a single source.

## What `sources/` Is Actually For

`sources/` is ONLY for:
- Bulk data imports (API dumps, CSV exports, snapshots)
- Raw data that feeds multiple brain pages (e.g., a guest export, contact sync)
- Periodic captures (quarterly snapshots, sync exports)

If the content has a clear primary subject (a person, company, concept, policy
issue), it does NOT go in sources/. Period.

## Notability Gate

Not everything deserves a brain page. Before creating a new entity page:
- **People:** Will you interact with them again? Are they relevant to your work?
- **Companies:** Are they relevant to your work or interests?
- **Concepts:** Is this a reusable mental model worth referencing later?
- **When in doubt, DON'T create.** A missing page can be created later.
  A junk page wastes attention and degrades search quality.

## Iron Law: Back-Linking (MANDATORY)

Every mention of a person or company with a brain page MUST create a back-link
FROM that entity's page TO the page mentioning them. This is bidirectional:
the new page links to the entity, AND the entity's page links back.

Format for back-links (append to Timeline or See Also):
```
- **YYYY-MM-DD** | Referenced in [page title](path/to/page.md) -- brief context
```

An unlinked mention is a broken brain. The graph is the intelligence.

## Citation Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every fact written to a brain page must carry an inline `[Source: ...]` citation.

Three formats:
- **Direct attribution:** `[Source: User, {context}, YYYY-MM-DD]`
- **API/external:** `[Source: {provider}, YYYY-MM-DD]` or `[Source: {publication}, {URL}]`
- **Synthesis:** `[Source: compiled from {list of sources}]`

Source precedence (highest to lowest):
1. User's direct statements (highest authority)
2. Compiled truth (pre-existing brain synthesis)
3. Timeline entries (raw evidence)
4. External sources (API enrichment, web search -- lowest)

When sources conflict, note the contradiction with both citations. Don't
silently pick one.

## Raw Source Preservation

Every ingested item should have its raw source preserved for provenance.

**Size routing (automatic via `gbrain files upload-raw`):**
- **< 100 MB text/PDF**: stays in the brain repo (git-tracked) in a `.raw/`
  sidecar directory alongside the brain page
- **>= 100 MB OR media files** (video, audio, images): uploaded to cloud
  storage (Supabase Storage, S3, etc.) with a `.redirect.yaml` pointer left
  in the brain repo. Files >= 100 MB use TUS resumable upload (6 MB chunks
  with retry) for reliability.

**Upload command:**
```bash
gbrain files upload-raw <file> --page <page-slug> --type <type>
```
Returns JSON: `{storage: "git"}` for small files, `{storage: "supabase", storagePath, reference}` for cloud.

**The `.redirect.yaml` pointer format:**
```yaml
target: supabase://brain-files/page-slug/filename.mp4
bucket: brain-files
storage_path: page-slug/filename.mp4
size: 524288000
size_human: 500 MB
hash: sha256:abc123...
mime: video/mp4
uploaded: 2026-04-11T...
type: transcript
```

**Accessing stored files:**
```bash
gbrain files signed-url <storage-path>    # Generate 1-hour signed URL
gbrain files restore <dir>                # Download back to local
```

This ensures any derived brain page can be traced back to its original source,
and large files don't bloat the git repo.

## Dream-cycle synthesize / patterns directories (v0.23)

The `synthesize` and `patterns` phases of `gbrain dream` write to a
**fixed allow-list** of paths sourced from `_brain-filing-rules.json`'s
`dream_synthesize_paths.globs` array. Editing that JSON is the ONLY way
to add a new directory the synthesis subagent may write to:

| Output type | Slug pattern | What goes here |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Reflection | `wiki/personal/reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-<hash[:6]>` | Self-knowledge, emotional processing, pattern recognition. Verbatim quotes from the user, with analysis. |
| Original idea | `wiki/originals/ideas/YYYY-MM-DD-<idea>-<hash[:6]>` | New frames, theses, mental models, "conceptive ideologist" outputs. Capture the user's exact phrasing — that's the artifact. |
| People enrichment | `wiki/people/<existing-slug>` | Timeline entries appended to existing people pages from session mentions. Stub pages for new substantive people. |
| Pattern | `wiki/personal/patterns/<theme>` | Cross-session theme detected across ≥3 reflections. Highest-leverage output: a pattern can span 25 years if reflections reference dated content. |
| Cycle summary | `dream-cycle-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD` | Index of every page produced by one dream cycle. Auto-written deterministically by the orchestrator. |

**Iron Law for synthesize output:**
1. Quote the user verbatim. Quotation marks are ONLY for spans reproducible
   EXACTLY from the source transcript — if you cannot reproduce a span
   exactly, paraphrase it WITHOUT quotation marks. Do not paraphrase
   memorable phrasings you can quote exactly. A mechanical, zero-LLM verify
   pass re-checks every quote, speaker attribution and number after the write,
   repairs what it can, and moves any sentence it cannot ground out of the
   page into `unverified_claims` (`dream.synthesize.quote_verify`, default on).
2. Cross-reference compulsively: every new page MUST link to existing brain content.
3. Slug discipline: lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only, slash-separated. NO underscores, NO file extensions.
4. Edited transcripts produce NEW slugs (content-hash suffix changes) — never silently overwrite a prior reflection.
5. Preserve concrete facts: carry the specific numbers, dates, dollar amounts,
   names, and who-decided-what of the salient content you write about, exactly
   as the source states them. Do not add routine logistics for their own sake.
6. Ground every claim in the source. Attribute speculation as speculation
   ("the user wondered whether…"), and never state a completion state or an
   outcome the source does not show.

## Takes attribution (v0.32+)

When writing a `<!--- gbrain:takes:begin -->` fence, the **holder** column says
WHO BELIEVES the claim, not who it's ABOUT. Cross-modal eval over 100K
production takes scored attribution at 6.5/10 — holder/subject confusion was
the #1 error. These six rules are the contract. Long form with worked
examples lives in `docs/takes-vs-facts.md`.

1. **Holder ≠ subject.** The test: did this person SAY or CLEARLY IMPLY this?
   - YES → `holder = people/<slug>`
   - NO, it's your analysis OF them → `holder = brain`
   - Example: "Garry has a hero/rescuer pattern" → `holder=brain` (analysis ABOUT Garry, not stated BY Garry)
2. **Atomic claims.** Split compound rows into separate rows. One claim per row.
3. **Amplification ≠ endorsement.** A retweet-only signal caps at `weight 0.55`.
   The user shared something; they didn't necessarily endorse every clause.
4. **Self-reported ≠ verified.** "Saif reports 7 figures" → `holder=people/saif`,
   `weight=0.75`, NOT `holder=world/1.0`. Self-report is a strong individual
   signal, not consensus fact.
5. **No false precision.** Use 0.05 increments only (`0.35`, `0.55`, `0.75`).
   `0.74` and `0.82` imply calibration accuracy that doesn't exist. The engine
   layer rounds on insert — match the grid in your fence and avoid the warning.
6. **"So what" test.** Skip metadata-style trivia (Twitter handles, follower
   counts, obvious bio fields). A take has to be load-bearing for some future
   query.

**Holder format (enforced as a parser warning in v0.32, error in v0.33+):**
- `world` (consensus fact, no individual claimant)
- `brain` (AI-inferred, holder genuinely ambiguous)
- `people/<slug>` (individual's stated belief)
- `companies/<slug>` (institutional fact, no individual claimant)

Slugs use the standard grammar (`[a-z0-9._-]+`). `Garry`, `people/Garry-Tan`,
and `world/garry-tan` all fail validation.

**Write takes with `takes_add`, not by hand.** `takes_add` (and `takes_update`
for an existing row) writes the row for you: it allocates the row number,
accepts only the four kinds (`fact`, `take`, `bet`, `hunch`), and keeps the
fence's markers and header canonical, so the page never needs fence repair.
Give it a canonical holder: `world`, `brain`, `people/<slug>` or
`companies/<slug>`, with a lowercase slug (`people/alice-example`,
`companies/acme-example`). A display name (`Alice Example`), a bare first
name or an assistant label is not a holder: gbrain rewrites assistant labels
(`System`, `assistant`) to `brain`, resolves a name only when it matches
exactly one `people/` or `companies/` page, and otherwise refuses the write
or holds the file for a person to fix. Facts rows go through `remember` the same way. Write a fence
table by hand only when the user asks for one, and then follow the exact
format in `docs/guides/fence-format.md`.

**Founder-describing-own-company rule.** When a founder describes their own
company, the holder is the FOUNDER, not the company. "We can hit $10M ARR"
said by Bo Lu → `holder=people/bo-lu`, NOT `holder=companies/clipboard-health`.
Companies don't speak; their employees do.
