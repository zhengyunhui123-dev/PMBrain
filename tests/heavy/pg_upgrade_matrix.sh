# Schema-migration walk-forward matrix. For each "historical shape," build the
# fixture, then run `gbrain doctor` and assert it reaches LATEST cleanly.
#
# This exercises the bootstrap → SCHEMA_SQL → runMigrations path against
# real Postgres (the pre-existing test/e2e/postgres-bootstrap.test.ts covers
# the engine-level case; this matrix runs it end-to-end via the CLI shell
# under multiple simulated historical brain shapes).
#
# Why the matrix matters: the 10+ forward-reference bugs documented in
# CLAUDE.md (#239/#243/#266/#357/#366/#374/#375/#378/#395/#396) all shipped
# because a new release added a column-with-index in the schema blob without
# the corresponding bootstrap probe. Walking forward from multiple legacy
# shapes catches the next member of that bug class before users hit it.
#
# Honest contract (smoke-tested 2026-05-19): this matrix catches whole-system
# wedges, not single-layer bootstrap regressions. gbrain has a multi-layer
# defense (bootstrap → SCHEMA_SQL replay → migrations → verifySchema), and
# any one layer can heal what an upstream layer misses. We verified that
# stubbing out `applyForwardReferenceBootstrap` entirely still produces a
# clean walk-forward on both shapes — the downstream layers cover it. The
# matrix detects: (a) a regression that breaks ALL repair layers for a given
# column, (b) genuine wedge bugs where a hard SQL error escapes every layer,
# (c) timeouts in the walk-forward path. Single-layer regressions are caught
# by `test/schema-bootstrap-coverage.test.ts` (static) and
# `test/e2e/postgres-bootstrap.test.ts` (engine-level).
