# tests/heavy/build_legacy_fixtures.sh
# Build a legacy brain fixture by:
#   1. Bringing a fresh DB to LATEST shape (via `gbrain doctor` which triggers initSchema)
#   2. Applying a down-mutation SQL file to strip forward-referenced state
#
# Deterministic alternative to committed pg_dump blobs (which rot via pg_dump
# version noise, opaque diffs, and undocumented regeneration). The down-mutate
# pattern matches what test/bootstrap.test.ts uses for PGLite.
#
# Usage:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... ./tests/heavy/build_legacy_fixtures.sh <shape>
#
# Where <shape> is one of:
#   pre-v0.13   — strip link_source/origin_page_id; version=10
#   pre-v0.18   — strip pages.source_id + sources table; version=20
#
# Honest limitation: this is a down-mutation simulation, not a real historical
# snapshot. Codex flagged this in plan review as "weak simulation" — it can't
# simulate every possible historical state. Acceptable here because the
# bootstrap's contract is narrow: "given a brain that lacks the specific
# forward-references, initSchema produces a brain at LATEST." This script
# exercises exactly that contract, across multiple historical shapes.
